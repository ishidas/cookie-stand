//CODE REVIEW: BRANDON
Table Rows --> 3 pieces you have to make: location name, hourly total, daily total

//What if we put all locations into array? instead of calling each locations-->
//at the top
var locations = [];

//inside of function
functions CookieStand(storeLocation, mn...) {
locations.push(this);

function displayAllLocations() {
for (car i = 0; i < locations.length; i++) {
  locations[i].displayData();
}

  document.body.appendChild(tbl);
}

//displayAllLocations();
//when someone is trying to create a form, maybe we may wanna place
//data in the form for new location (min, max, ave)--> when form submitted--create instance--display locations will display.
function updateLocation() {
  pikePlace.avePerCust = 0;
  displayAllLocations();
//not exactly like this, but similar to this when form is attached
}

updateLocation(0;)
